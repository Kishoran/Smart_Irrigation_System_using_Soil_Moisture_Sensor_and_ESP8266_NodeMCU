## Introduction
Efficient water management is crucial for sustainable agriculture and gardening. Traditional irrigation methods often lead to water wastage, either through over-irrigation or under-irrigation, which can adversely affect plant health and yield. To address these challenges, a Smart Irrigation System leveraging modern technologies can be employed to optimize water usage and ensure that plants receive the right amount of water at the right time.

This project focuses on developing a Smart Irrigation System using soil moisture sensors and an ESP8266 NodeMCU. The soil moisture sensors continuously monitor the moisture levels in the soil, providing real-time data on the soil's water content. The ESP8266 NodeMCU, a versatile and cost-effective Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller, acts as the system's brain, processing the sensor data and controlling the irrigation system accordingly.
